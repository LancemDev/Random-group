# Random-group
This is a simple python program that takes in a csv file and groups them into 8 groups. Statically having the number of groups as 8 might not have been as wise but then you are free to specify the number of groups
The program uses the pandas lib to get data into a dataframe and random lib for the random arrangement. 
I'm not including the actual csv files that I used for obvious privacy issues
